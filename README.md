# random-assignment
Working with .txt files, randomly assigns tasks from a list to people from another list.  Pools unassigned tasks separately.

This code takes in a text list of people (people.txt) and a text list of assignments (assignments.txt).  In each list, each person/assignment should be separated by newlines.

## Here's how to use it!
1. Download this code.
2. Open up people.txt and assignments.txt.  Replace their contents with your own lists of people and assignments, separated by newlines.
3. Run main.py.  If asked what program to use, select "Python".  This will alter output_pairings.txt, or create a new output_pairings.txt, if the old one doesn't exist.
4. Open up output_parings.txt.  Now you have all your people and assignments!  You can just copy-paste them into Zoom.
5. If someone doesn't like their assignment, you can give them a new one from the leftovers.
